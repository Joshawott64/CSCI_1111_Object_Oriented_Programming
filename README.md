# Object Oriented Programming for Software students
 
* Joshua Gray, Southwest Technical College, Object Oriented Programming.
* This repository is designated for the Object Oriented Programming class. It will hold all files related to the course.
* I discovered my coding talent when I was a junior in high school. Ever since, I have been looking for opportunities to hone my skills and learn as much as I can. That lead me to compete in FBLA and enroll in Southwest Technical College's software development program.
* My end goal for this program is to be prepared for the professional coding world.
